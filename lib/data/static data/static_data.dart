            "The complex is a vast open site and includes the Karnak Open Air Museum. It is believed to be the second-most-visited [citation needed] historical site in Egypt; only the Giza pyramid complex near Cairo receives more visits. It consists of four main parts, of which only the largest is currently open to the public. The term Karnak often is understood as being the Precinct of Amun-Re only, because this is the only part most visitors see. The three other parts, the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Montu, and the dismantled Temple of Amenhotep IV, are closed to the public. There also are a few smaller temples and sanctuaries connecting the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Amun-Re, and the Luxor Temple. The Precinct of Mut is very ancient, being dedicated to an Earth and creation deity, but not yet restored. The original temple was destroyed and partially restored by Hatshepsut, although another pharaoh built around it in order to change the focus or orientation of the sacred area. Many portions of it may have been carried away for use in other buildings.",

The most well-known pyramid is the Great Pyramid of Giza, built for Pharaoh Khufu. These massive structures reflect the ancient Egyptians' advanced knowledge of engineering, mathematics, and astronomy. Today, the pyramids continue to attract millions of visitors and remain a symbol of Egypt’s rich history and civilization.",
